        <h1>Recipe: Oma Soup</h1>

        <!--Image here-->

        <p>Oma used to make this soup for me growing up when ever I was sick. I remember staying home from school, watching Recess and Hey Arnold and eating this soup from the couch.</p>
        <p>It uses basic ingredients and can be customized however you want. Which is part of why I love it so much. Oma always made it with carrots, which is why I included it here. But you can use any shreddable vegetable really.</p>
       
        <h2>The Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Oatmeal</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>
            <li>Broth</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll need some sort of fat to toast the oatmeal. I use butter.</p>
        <p>You'll also at least need salt to season this thing. But that's up to you.</p>
