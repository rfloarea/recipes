        <h1>Recipe: Oma Soup</h1>

        <!--Image here-->

        <p>Oma used to make this soup for me growing up when ever I was sick. I remember staying home from school, watching Recess and Hey Arnold and eating this soup from the couch.</p>
        <p>It uses basic ingredients and can be customized however you want. Which is part of why I love it so much. Oma always made it with carrots, which is why I included it here. But you can use any shreddable vegetable really.</p>
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Oatmeal</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>
            <li>Broth</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Seasoning (salt, pepper, an herb like parsley or something)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll need some sort of fat to toast the oatmeal. I use butter.</p>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Toast oats in a pan with fat</li>
            <li>Shred and aadd carrot to oats</li>
            <li>Add broth</li>
            <li>Whisk in egg</li>
            <li>Season to taste</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So now you know what to eat the next time you or a loved one is sick. It's really very comforting and nourishing.</p>
