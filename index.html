        <h1>Recipes</h1>

        <p>Hello! This website exists to share recipes that I find comforting, fun, and tasty.</p>
        <p>It also exists as a means to learn how to actually make a website. My intention is to write every line of code that powers this site. And know when to use outside sources if needed.</p>
        
        <h2>List of recipes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Oma Soup</li>
            <li>Mum's Beef and Noodle Dinner</li>
            <li>Cranberry Orange Winter Loaf</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each page includes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A picture of the finished product</li>
            <li>List of ingredients</li>
            <li>Cooking or baking instructions</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Also, each recipe includes a little anecdote about my connection to it. It's a little <em>personal flavor</em> if you will. Bad pun, I'm sorry.</p>
